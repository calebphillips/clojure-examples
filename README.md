Collection of examples that have caught my eye and that I would like to practices.  The idea is that they are mostly 
short functions that I can easily practice while waiting for tests to run, etc.  Not as involved as a kata.
They come from books, tweets, blogs, questions I have...  I have tried to provide references in the source.
